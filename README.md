# RabbitMQ + Laravel implementation - shop app example

Boom! This is my example of microservices implementation for shop application, so first of all - each folder in this repostory is a separate microservice that have own resposibilities.

List of all microservices:
- Identity - for authorization and saving user data/tokens
- Catalog - as name suggest, this microservice is responsible for products
- Orders - microservice responsible for checkout and orders
- Basket - and finally, all cart products for users are stored here
